# Important Folder Paths

This file tells you every necessary path which is on the controller. To get to the folders you can follow [./Controller_Guide.md](./Controller_Guide.md). Theoretically you can just plug in a keyboard and type in the terminal to access every path, but for the less experienced user this is a little bit too advanced, so you might just get into the file explorer.
