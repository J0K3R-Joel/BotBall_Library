# Ideas for the future

This file has ideas for future use or methods that can be programmed at some point in the future. 

You can try to create implementations for those ideas and send them to me alongside proof and afterwards I will implement it so every user can use your own method. (Feel free to add your name inside the docstring inside of the function ;) ) 

You can also send me your own ideas so I can implement them in here as well for future generations to create an implementation of the idea.
