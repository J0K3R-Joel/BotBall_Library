# Getting Started

Welcome, this document is an introduction to the BotBall Event. This file will cover the complete basics of the competition itself â€“ the rules, structure, and general concepts â€“ without going into the specifics of using this library.  

If you are new to BotBall and want to understand the event before working with the code, this is the right place to start.

This website [ECER | Documents](https://ecer.pria.at/documents) could be important for you, since everything is listed here. This will be your best friend at some point

Consider this since it could be that some things are deprecated!

## 1. Preparation

Before you start, consider that you have access the following points:

- At least one controller (wallaby / wombat / ...)

- Internet connection (in the beginning, so you can read the documentations)

- A PC for programming

- Sensors and maybe LEGO or metal parts, so you can design hardware

---

## 2. Hardware

- Check out the available parts in the parts lists ([Electronics](https://ecer.pria.at/documents/2025/botball/parts-lists/2025%20Electronics%20Kit.pdf), [Metal](https://ecer.pria.at/documents/2025/botball/parts-lists/2025%20KIPR%20Metal%20Parts%20v1.1.pdf) and [LEGO](https://ecer.pria.at/documents/2025/botball/parts-lists/2025%20Lego%20Parts.pdf)). These are the websites for 2025! Watch out for deprecation!

- Some things you are able to use which are not listed in those parts are listed in the game rules, so you need to consider them as well

- All things considered your imagination has no boundaries for building and / or adding the Hardware to the controller, as long as you are following the rules and are not exceeding the allowed parts for usage

- **HINT**: it is useful to write a parts list on you own where you can see which parts are used and how often they are used

## 3. Software (programming)

1. Plug in and turn on the controller

2. Once it booted,  





## 5. Spieleablauf

- seeding

- double elim

- paper

- documentation

## 4. Projekt starten

Starte das Projekt im Entwicklungsmodus:

`npm run dev`

Danach kannst du die Anwendung normalerweise hier aufrufen:  
ðŸ‘‰ [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 5. NÃ¤chste Schritte

- Schaue dir den Code im Ordner `src/` an â€“ dort findest du den Kern des Projekts.

- Lies dir die Kommentare im Code durch, um die Struktur zu verstehen.

- Weitere Infos findest du auch in der README.md.
