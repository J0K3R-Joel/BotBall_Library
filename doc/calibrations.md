# Calibration

This file tells you how to calibrate the wallaby / wombat / controller / ... . Calibration is very important to ensure consistency. The more you calibrate the better. My calibration methods are written into files in `/usr/lib/bias_folder`, so you just need to properly calibrate them once and every function that needs those calibrations will read from the desired file. If you want the most current bias and therefore need to calibrate them while setting up, then the more you calibrate the longer it will take.
