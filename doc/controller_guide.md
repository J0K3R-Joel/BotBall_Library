# Controller Explainer

This file acts as a guide for every necessary information given on the controller and how to get to the information (step-by-step).

## Starting page

Every headline from now on will begin on the starting page, which looks like this:

![](C:\Joel_K\Schule\BotBall\BotBall_Library\doc\img\controller_starting_page.jpg)

You are able to see this page when 

- turning the controller on

- if you already clicked on a button, you can

  - click a button called `Home` 
  - click an `Exit` / `Back` button until you reach this page again

  
  
  ## Shutting down

##### Reason

It is recommended to always safely shut down the controller this way. It will close everything safely.

##### Navigation

1. Click the `Shut Down` button in the top center of the screen ![](./img/shut_down_page.png)



  ## Rebooting



##### Reason

Sometimes some problems will be fixed when rebooting the controller

##### Navigation

## Run local Programs

##### Reason

When you are at the BotBall (ECER / GCER) event you HAVE TO execute all your programs on the controller and not on the PC!

##### Navigation

1. Click the `Programs` button ![img](./img/programs_page.png)

2. Click on the User and Project file. This makes it, so the `main.py` file gets executed.![](./img/programs_user_page.png)

3. Click the `Run` button to execute the code ![](./img/programs_run_page.png)



## Viewing Sensor / Motor / Servo values
