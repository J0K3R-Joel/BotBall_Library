# Controller Explainer

This file acts as a guide for every necessary information given on the controller and how to get to the information (step-by-step).

## Starting page

Every headline from now on will begin on the starting page, which looks like this:

![](C:\Joel_K\Schule\BotBall\BotBall_Library\doc\img\controller_starting_page.jpg)

You are able to see this page when 

- turning the controller on

- if you already clicked on a button, you can

  - click a button called `Home` 
  - click an `Exit` / `Back` button until you reach this page again
