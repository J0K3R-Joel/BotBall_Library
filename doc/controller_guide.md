# Controller Explainer

This file acts as a guide for every necessary information given on the controller and how to get to the information (step-by-step).

## Starting page

Every headline from now on will begin on the starting page, which looks like this:

![](C:\Joel_K\Schule\BotBall\BotBall_Library\doc\img\controller_starting_page.jpg)

You are able to see this page when 

- turning the controller on

- if you already clicked on a button, you can

  - click a button called `Home` 
  - click an `Exit` / `Back` button until you reach this page again

  
  
  ## Shutting down

##### Reason

It is recommended to always safely shut down the controller this way. It will close everything safely.

##### Navigation

1. Click the `Shut Down` button in the top center of the screen ![](./img/shut_down_page.png)



  ## Rebooting



##### Reason

Sometimes some problems will be fixed when rebooting the controller

##### Navigation

1. Click the `Reboot` button ![](./img/reboot_page.png)



## Viewing WIFI settings

@TODO



## Run local Programs

##### Reason

When you are at the BotBall (ECER / GCER) event you HAVE TO execute all your programs on the controller and not on the PC!

##### Navigation

1. Click the `Programs` button ![img](./img/programs_page.png)

2. Click on the User and Project file. This makes it, so the `main.py` file gets executed.![](./img/programs_user_page.png)

3. Click the `Run` button to execute the code ![](./img/programs_run_page.png)



## Viewing Sensor / Motor / Servo values

##### Reason

1. **Motor**: You can test out, where a motor drives (forward, backward) when changing the value (positive, negative). You can also see the motor counter
2. **Servo**: You can enable / disable servos while also seeing the current value and changing the value / position
3. **Sensors**: You can see every analog, digital and inbuilt sensor values to test the values out

##### Navigation

1. Click on the `Motors and Sensors` button![](./img/values_page.png)

2. From here on, there are 5 options:

   1. ###### Motors:

       Click the `Motors` button ![](./img/values_motors_page.png)

       Here you can see every important information regarding motors.

       ![](./img/values_motors_interface_page.png)

       - **Port**: The physical location where the motor is plugged in. You can switch the port on the interface by clicking on it, if you want to access another port.
       - **Pointer of movement**: The visualization of the "Value of movement". Turn the pointer to one direction to make the motor go forward. Turn it the other way for going backward
       - **Value of movement**: Shows you where it is going (positive -> forward; negative -> backward)
       - **Position counter**: Values of movement added together 
   
   
   
   1. ###### Servos:
   
       Click the `Servos` button![](./img/values_servo_page.png)
       
       Here you can see every important information regarding servos.
       
       ![](./img/values_servo_interface_page.png)
       
       - **Port**: The physical location where the servo is plugged in. You can switch the port on the interface by clicking on it, if you want to access another port.
       - **Pointer of movement**: The visualization of the "Value of movement". Turn the pointer to one direction to make the servo go one way and turn it the other way to change it to the other way.
       - **Value of movement**: Shows you the current value it is set to
       - **On / Off**: Being able to change the value (Enable) or not being able to change the value (Disable)
